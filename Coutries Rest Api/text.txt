get your font sizes in check man before you put any padding.(if not then repeat)


learnings:-
people does not use 
<select name="fdffdfdd" id="fdf"></select>
because there is less modification opition with it to create drop down menu.

margin-inline: auto; ==> margin in the left and right direction "auto" as happens in the case of padding.-- or margin-block iska ulta hota hai means top and bottom.

pointer-events:none;
pointer-events:auto;
i learned about this properties while making the drop-down menu,what this property does is does not allow the user to perform any pointer events, and make the block feel non-existent.it is necessary as i would have generated a problem because at the 0 opacity also user could have selected the option, display none could have also prevented it but transitions property does not work when display properties are getting updated or changed.

whenever coding for with a specific data that varies at different points always check the code with maximum possibility so the code does not breaks.

localStorage only stores strings in it and that is why before adding object and array in local storage i have to stringify it and later parse it back when retrieving it and stringify= converting a non-string value into string.
